I'd rate your program a 4 out of 5. Here's the breakdown:

Positives:

    Clarity and Readability: Your code is generally clear and easy to read. You've used meaningful variable names and organized your code well.

    Error Handling: You've appropriately handled the error case when the input contains non-numeric characters. Good job using strconv.Atoi and checking for errors.

    User Interaction: You prompt the user for input, and the messages are clear and informative.

    Functionality: The program accomplishes the specified task effectively by converting input to an integer, performing an increment, and converting the result back to a string.

Suggestions for Improvement:

    Comments: While your code is relatively clear, consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each function and any complex logic. This can be especially helpful for others (or yourself) who might read the code later.

    User-Friendly Messages: You could enhance user interaction by providing more user-friendly messages. For example, after reading the number, you could print a message like "You entered: {number}" before proceeding.

    Function Signature: The increment_number function takes an integer as an argument and returns a string. Consider updating the function signature to reflect this, making it more intuitive for other developers.

    go

    func increment_number(num int) string {

Overall, your program is well-written and achieves its goal. The suggested improvements are relatively minor and aim to enhance code documentation and user interaction.
