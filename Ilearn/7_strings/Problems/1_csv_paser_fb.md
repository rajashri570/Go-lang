Let's review your CSV parser code with the recent error handling improvements:

    Code Structure and Readability: 4/5
        The code structure is clear, and variable names are descriptive.
        The function getCSV could be renamed for better clarity, perhaps to something like parseCSV.

    Error Handling: 4/5
        You've added error handling for both reading input and parsing CSV, which is a significant improvement.

    Documentation: 2/5
        Comments explaining the purpose of the functions and the overall logic would improve readability.

    Code Modularity: 3/5
        The code is somewhat modular with a separate function for CSV parsing, but there's still room for improvement.

    User Interface: 3/5
        The user interface is simple, but providing more information or instructions for the user would be helpful.

    Testing: 2/5
        Including some tests for the CSV parsing function would improve the reliability of your code.

    Error Message Quality: 3/5
        The error message for a general error during input reading is a bit vague. Providing a more informative error message would be better.

    Handling of Newlines in Input: 2/5
        Your code expects input in a single line. Handling multiple lines or trimming excess whitespace could be beneficial.

    Overall: 2.6/5
        The code is functional for basic CSV input, and the addition of error handling is a positive step. There's still room for improvement in documentation, modularity, and testing. Consider addressing these aspects for a more robust and maintainable CSV parser.
