I would rate your code a 3.5. It accomplishes its task, but there are some areas for improvement:

    Variable Naming (3/5):
        utf_str could be named more descriptively, such as inputString.
        Consider using more descriptive names for count and cnt.

    Magic Number (3/5):
        The number 127 is a magic number. It would be better to use a named constant or a comment to explain its significance.

    Comments (3/5):
        Comments are present but could be more descriptive. Add comments explaining the purpose of the code or any complex logic.

    Printf Format (3.5/5):
        Consider using %U in Printf statements to print the Unicode format of the character, especially for non-ASCII characters.

    Error Handling (3.5/5):
        The code does not handle errors returned by utf8.DecodeRuneInString. It's generally a good idea to check for errors, especially for educational purposes.

    Consistency (3.5/5):
        Consistency in variable naming and formatting is crucial. Stick to one style, either snake_case or camelCase.

    Efficiency (4/5):
        The first loop could be more efficient by using the utf8.RuneCountInString function to get the rune count directly.

    Additional Checks (3.5/5):
        Depending on the use case, you might want to consider additional checks, such as handling invalid UTF-8 sequences in the input string.

Overall, your code is functional, but there is room for improvement in terms of clarity, consistency, and handling potential errors.
