In Go, function parameters are passed by value, not by reference. This means that when you pass a variable to a function, a copy of its value is passed to the function rather than the actual variable itself. Understanding this concept is crucial for writing correct and predictable Go code. Let's delve into this in more detail:

Pass by Value:

```go

package main

import "fmt"

// Function that modifies a parameter
func modifyValue(x int) {
    x = x * 2
    fmt.Println("Inside modifyValue:", x)
}

// Function that modifies a pointer to a variable
func modifyPointer(y *int) {
    *y = *y * 2
    fmt.Println("Inside modifyPointer:", *y)
}

func main() {
    // Example with pass by value
    value := 10
    modifyValue(value)
    fmt.Println("Outside modifyValue:", value)

    // Example with pass by pointer (reference)
    pointerValue := 10
    modifyPointer(&pointerValue)
    fmt.Println("Outside modifyPointer:", pointerValue)
}
```

In the modifyValue function, we pass an integer (value) by value. Any modifications made to the parameter x inside the function do not affect the original variable value outside the function.

In the modifyPointer function, we pass a pointer to an integer (pointerValue) to simulate pass by reference. In this case, modifications made to the value pointed to by y inside the function directly affect the original variable pointerValue outside the function.

# Key Points:
1. Pass by Value:

For basic types (integers, floats, booleans, etc.), the actual value is passed to the function.
Modifications to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable outside the function.

2. Pass by Pointer (Reference):

For complex types (slices, maps, structs), a copy of the reference (memory address) is passed to the function.
Modifications to the underlying data via the pointer inside the function do affect the original variable outside the function. It is still pass by value, only the underlying variable stores the reference/pointer to the object of complex type. 

3. Use Pointers for Modification:

If you need a function to modify the original variable, you should pass a pointer to that variable.
Understanding pass by value and pass by reference in Go helps in writing functions that behave predictably and avoids unexpected side effects. It's a deliberate design choice in Go to ensure simplicity, clarity, and safety in code.

In Go, all function arguments, including those representing complex types like slices, maps, and structs, are passed by value. However, for slices and maps, the underlying data structures are references, so the copy of the value passed to the function still refers to the same underlying data.

Let's take a look at an example to illustrate this:

```go

package main

import "fmt"

// Function that modifies a slice
func modifySlice(slice []int) {
    // Modifying the slice, which affects the original data
    slice[0] = 100
    slice = append(slice, 200) // This does not affect the original slice outside the function
}

func main() {
    // Creating a slice
    originalSlice := []int{1, 2, 3}

    // Passing the slice to the function
    modifySlice(originalSlice)

    // The original slice is modified
    fmt.Println("Outside modifySlice:", originalSlice)
}
```

In this example, the modifySlice function takes a slice as a parameter. Changes made to the elements of the slice inside the function affect the original data, but appending a new element to the slice inside the function does not affect the original slice outside the function.


```go

package main

import "fmt"

// Function that modifies a slice using a pointer
func modifySliceWithPointer(slice *[]int) {
    *slice = append(*slice, 200)
}

func main() {
    // Creating a slice
    originalSlice := []int{1, 2, 3}

    // Passing a pointer to the slice to the function
    modifySliceWithPointer(&originalSlice)

    // The original slice is modified
    fmt.Println("Outside modifySliceWithPointer:", originalSlice)
}
```

In this case, the function modifySliceWithPointer takes a pointer to a slice, allowing modifications to affect the original slice outside the function.

In Go, slices and maps are both reference types, and when you pass them to a function, you are passing a copy of the reference to the underlying data. This means that modifications made to the data (like changing the elements in a slice or updating values in a map) inside the function will be visible outside the function because the reference to the underlying data is shared.

When I mentioned "the slice or map itself is still passed by value," I was emphasizing that the reference to the underlying data is what's being passed by value. In other words, the function receives a copy of the reference, not a new reference. This is what allows changes to the data to be reflected outside the function.

Here's a simpler way to put it:

Slices and Maps: When you pass a slice or a map to a function, the function gets a copy of the reference to the underlying data. Modifications to the data inside the function affect the original data outside the function.
