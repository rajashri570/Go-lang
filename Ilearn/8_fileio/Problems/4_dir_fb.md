Certainly, here's a review of your code with ratings:

    Error Handling: 4/5
        You handle errors when opening the file and getting the current working directory, which is good.
        Consider printing more informative error messages to help with debugging.

    Code Structure: 4/5
        The code structure is generally good.
        It would be beneficial to encapsulate the logic into functions for better readability and reusability.

    Readability: 4/5
        The code is readable, and the variable names are descriptive.
        Adding comments to explain the purpose of the code blocks and any specific logic could improve readability further.

    Logic and Flow: 4/5
        The logic for constructing the file path and separating names from the full path is clear.
        Using strings.Repeat for indentation is a good choice.

    Completeness: 4/5
        The program generates a tree-like structure representing the hierarchy of files and directories, meeting the specified task.
        Consider handling cases where the file may not be found or where the specified path is a directory instead of a file.

Overall, your code is well-structured and accomplishes the task. Adding more detailed error messages and encapsulating logic into functions could further improve the code. Great effort!
