Sure, here's a review of your code with ratings:

    Error Handling: 4/5
        You correctly use os.Stat to check for errors and handle them appropriately.
        You print an error message when needed.

    Defer Statement: 5/5
        The use of defer source.Close() is good practice to ensure that the source file is closed even if an error occurs.

    Logic and Flow: 5/5
        The logic is clear and straightforward.
        Checking if the source file is empty before copying is a good preventive measure.

    Readability: 4/5
        The code is readable, but you might consider adding more comments to explain the purpose of certain blocks or decisions.

    Code Structure: 4/5
        The code structure is good, but you could organize it into separate functions for better modularization.
        Consider breaking the copying logic into a separate function.

Overall, your code is well-structured and achieves the goal of checking if the source file is empty before copying. Adding a few more comments for clarification could further improve readability. The ratings are subjective, and the scores are quite good. Keep up the good work!
