Certainly, I'll provide a review of your code using a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the least and 5 is the highest:

    Code Structure and Readability: 4/5
        Overall, the structure is good, and the functions are appropriately named.
        The indentation is consistent.
        Consider using camelCase for function names (e.g., count_lines can be countLines) to follow Go's naming conventions.

    Error Handling: 3/5
        Error handling is present, but the error messages could be more informative.
        Instead of printing an error message in the write function, consider returning the error and handling it in the main function.

    Efficiency: 4/5
        The use of bufio.Reader for efficient line-by-line reading is appropriate.
        However, there's a minor inefficiency in the write function. It could return an error to the caller rather than printing an error message directly.

    Clarity and Comments: 3/5
        Comments are minimal. Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of the functions and any complex logic.
        The comment in the count_lines function about "End of input or error" could be clearer.

    Completeness: 4/5
        The program accomplishes the task of counting lines in a text file.
        It correctly identifies an empty file.

Overall, your code is well-structured, and it achieves the specified task. Consider incorporating more informative error messages and adding comments for improved clarity. Additionally, follow Go's naming conventions for functions.
