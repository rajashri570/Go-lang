I'll provide a brief review of your code:

    Correctness: The program seems to correctly read the file, replace occurrences of the specified word, and write the modified content back to the file.

    Readability: The code is relatively readable, but it could benefit from more comments to explain the purpose of certain sections or any complex logic.

    Error Handling: The program includes basic error handling for file operations, which is good. However, it might be beneficial to provide more descriptive error messages.

    Efficiency: The program reads and writes the entire file at once, which may not be efficient for very large files. For larger files, consider reading and writing the file in smaller chunks.

    Flexibility: The program is hardcoded to replace occurrences of "golang" with "python." It could be more flexible by allowing the user to specify the words to replace.

Overall, I would rate your code a 3.5 out of 5. It performs the task but could be improved in terms of readability and flexibility.
