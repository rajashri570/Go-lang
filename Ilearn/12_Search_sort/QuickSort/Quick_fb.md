I would rate the provided quick.go and main.go for the QuickSort implementation a 4 out of 5. Here are the considerations:

    Correctness and Functionality (4/5):
        The QuickSort implementation in quick.go seems correct, and the main.go program generates a random array, sorts it using QuickSort, and prints the results. However, it could benefit from additional testing with various input scenarios.

    Code Structure and Readability (4/5):
        The code structure is clear, and variable names are descriptive.
        The logic in Quick_sort is understandable. However, using multiple slices to separate left and right subarrays might be less efficient than partitioning in-place.

    User Interaction (N/A):
        The provided code does not involve direct user interaction as it focuses on sorting. If user interaction is necessary in your specific use case, consider adding relevant features.

    Error Handling (3/5):
        The code lacks input validation or error handling. It assumes that the input array is not nil. It's advisable to include checks for such cases.

    Code Comments (3/5):
        The comments are minimal. Adding comments to explain the logic and purpose of the code, especially in the Quick_sort function, would be helpful for future understanding.

    Package Structure (4/5):
        The package structure is appropriate. However, you might want to consider organizing your code into separate packages or files as the codebase grows.

    Random Number Generation (4/5):
        The random number generation in the main function is good, but you might want to consider using a global rand.Seed initialization rather than calling it inside the loop.
