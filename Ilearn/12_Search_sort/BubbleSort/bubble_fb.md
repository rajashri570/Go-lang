I would rate the provided main.go code for the bubble sort program a 3 out of 5. Here are some considerations:

    Correctness and Functionality (3/5):
        The code appears to work correctly, implementing the bubble sort algorithm based on the user's choice of ascending or descending order.
        The menu system and user input handling are functional.

    Code Structure and Readability (3/5):
        The structure of the code is straightforward, but there is commented-out code in the main function that might be confusing. It's better to remove unnecessary or commented-out code for clarity.
        Variable names are clear and descriptive.

    User Interaction (2/5):
        The user interaction is basic and functional, but it could be improved for a better user experience. For example, providing more detailed instructions or handling unexpected inputs.

    Error Handling (2/5):
        The code lacks robust error handling. It would be good to add checks for potential errors, especially when reading user input.

    Code Comments (2/5):
        The code lacks comments, which could make it difficult for someone else (or even yourself in the future) to understand the purpose of each part. Consider adding comments to explain the logic.

    Package Structure (3/5):
        The package structure is reasonable, but you might want to consider organizing your code into separate packages or files for better maintainability as the codebase grows.
