I'll provide feedback on the provided Go program based on clarity, simplicity, and efficiency:

    Clarity and Simplicity: 4/5
        The program is relatively clear and simple to understand.
        The logic for creating substrings and checking for anagrams is straightforward.
        The function sortString is appropriately used to sort strings.

    Efficiency: 3/5
        The program generates substrings of length 3, which might be specific to the example. It's not generic for any length.
        It could be more efficient if it used a sliding window approach to avoid recomputing sorted substrings.

    Code Structure: 3/5
        The logic is implemented in the main function, and it might benefit from breaking it into smaller functions for better readability and modularity.

    Comments: 4/5
        The comments provide some clarity on what each part of the code does, but adding more comments, especially for the main steps, would enhance understanding.

    Overall: 3.5/5
        The program works correctly for the given problem, but there is room for improvement in terms of efficiency and code structure. Consider making the solution more generic and modular.
