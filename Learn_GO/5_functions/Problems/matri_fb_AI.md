    Code Readability: 4/5
        The code is generally readable and well-formatted. It uses meaningful variable names, and the structure is easy to follow.

    User Interaction: 3/5
        The user interaction is clear, but it could be improved by providing more information about the expected input (e.g., positive integers, etc.).

    Efficiency: 3/5
        The code checks the compatibility of matrices for multiplication, which is good. However, it does not perform the matrix multiplication as per the problem statement. Consider adding the actual matrix multiplication function.

    Matrix Initialization: 4/5
        The code correctly initializes matrices using slices. This is a good practice in Go.

    Comments and Documentation: 2/5
        The code lacks comments to explain the logic or any crucial steps. Adding comments could improve understanding, especially if someone else is reading or maintaining the code.

    Consistency: 4/5
        The code is consistent in terms of formatting and indentation, which is good.

    Edge Cases Handling: 3/5
        The code checks the compatibility of matrices, but it doesn't handle the case where the user enters a non-integer value. Adding some basic error checking and handling would improve robustness.

    Overall Rating: 3.5/5
        The code is well-structured, but it lacks a matrix multiplication function, comments, and could improve user interaction and handle errors more robustly.
